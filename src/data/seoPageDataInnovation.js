      { "question": "How does VMukti coordinate incident response across 100+ locations?", "answer": "VMukti's platform supports hierarchical operations: local sites respond to local incidents, regional coordinators oversee multi-site trends, corporate security handles enterprise-level threats. Cross-site queries enable instant correlation—connecting incidents across locations that might otherwise appear unrelated." },
      { "question": "Can each location maintain operational independence with VMukti?", "answer": "Yes. VMukti supports local autonomy—each site has local operators, local configuration, local alert handling. Headquarters maintains oversight but doesn't micromanage. This delegation model scales to 1,000+ locations with corporate coordination." },
      { "question": "What about bandwidth for managing 10,000+ cameras from cloud?", "answer": "VMukti's architecture minimizes bandwidth: only video metadata and alerts transmit to cloud, not raw video. Local sites retain full video copies. Bandwidth consumption is typically 10-15% of what raw video streaming would require." }
